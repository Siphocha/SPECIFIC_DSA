#For the Sparse Matrix program, remember:
- Pick different files.
- Multiplication option WILL strain the system as each file 400K+ lines with 3 integers per line times the other 400K+ lines of 3 integers per line...depending on your machine it can take a long time.
- Name the output file something memorable
